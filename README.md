## Steps to Build and Run Cairo Scripts

### 1. **Set Up Your Environment**

- **Install Scarb**

  Please refer to the [asdf documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) to install all prerequisites

  To get started, install Scarb by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
  asdf plugin add scarb
  asdf install scarb latest
  asdf global scarb latest
```

- **Verify Scarb Installation**

  Confirm that Scarb is installed correctly by checking its version:

```bash
scarb --version
```

### 2. **Navigate to the Scripts Directory**

First, navigate to the general cairo/scripts/ directory:

```bash
cd cairo/scripts/
```

Then, navigate to the specific script's directory you want to run. For example, if the script you want to execute is in a folder named example_script, navigate into that directory:

```bash
cd example_script
```

### 3. **Build the Project**

Build the project with the following command:

```bash
scarb build
```

### 4. **Run the Script**

To execute the main function of the script, use:
